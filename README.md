#Do female marriage ages affect economic growth? We used data from European countries + US and Canada to investigate the relationship between them. While panel regression results show a negative relationship, which means countries w/ lower female marriage age have higher GDP per capita, previous study shows that the correlation could be misleading since there are unmeasurable factors influencing economic growth, such as culture and kidnapping.
